# Phyllotaxis wallpaper for android

### Features

  - Wallpaper based on [Vogel’s formula](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch4.pdf);
  - Instead of growing indefinitely, the pattern grows until it reaches 500 drawn dots, and then the number of dots decrease in a reversed way;
  - Instead of using the angle defined on [Vogel’s formula](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch4.pdf), the wallpaper uses a random one on each iterarion, creating new patterns;
  - Each dot has a different colour, wich changes in each iteration, creating a beautiful *dégradé*
  - Done with [Processing](https://processing.org/)
  - Some screanshots:
