# Phyllotaxis wallpaper for android

### Features

  - Wallpaper based on [Vogel’s formula](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch4.pdf)
  - Instead of letting the pattern grow indefinitely, it just grows until reach 500 drawed dots, and then, is decreases the number of dots in a reversed way
  - Instead of the angle defined on [Vogel’s formula](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch4.pdf), this wallpaper uses a random angle in each iterarion, to make new patterns
  - Color is different in each dot, and changes in each iteration, making a beautiful degrade
  - Done with [Processing](https://processing.org/)
  - Some screanshots:
